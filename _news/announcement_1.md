Thanks to everyone at the Center for Social and Behavioral Science at the University of Illinois for hosting me to run [a workshop](https://csbs.research.illinois.edu/machine-learning-for-social-and-behavioral-science-workshop-oct-3/) on using ML in social science! I enjoyed meeting all of the students and faculty.
