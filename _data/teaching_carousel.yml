  quote: "This course was intense and demanding. I consistently spent around 17–18 hours per week on coursework, and found it to be both challenging and intellectually rigorous. The leap from the skills–based problem set to the applied one was well–designed; the applied assignment built effectively on the tools and concepts introduced earlier, reinforcing both technical and analytical competencies. It was a true challenge, and I learned a great deal. The fast pace and difficulty pushed me to deepen my understanding of python tools, and methods."
