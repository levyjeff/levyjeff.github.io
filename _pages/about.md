I am an economist and assistant instructional professor in public policy focusing on the intersection of data science and social science. My research focuses on macroeconomics and economic uncertainty, particularly the causes and impacts of economic uncertainty on the real economy, following a long line of economists from [Keynes](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/51/2/209/1939387), [Knight](https://mises.org/sites/default/files/Risk,%20Uncertainty,%20and%20Profit_4.pdf), [Bernanke](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/98/1/85/1869115), [Romer](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/105/3/597/1864581) and more recently, [Alexopoulos and Cohen](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1059056015000246?casa_token=6RCqOTGfNT4AAAAA:3UJ3dQVSy6GapzSbMtLgF3ikJLAWuzXtRMZQpPWudoI13xJVpW-u5UnHWtQWlJUV2YEAgy6G-w), and [Baker, Bloom and Davis](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/131/4/1593/2468873). I am also pursuing research on pedagogy and prediction using machine learning techniques.

In the classroom I have experience teaching priniciples of economics courses to both undergraduate and graduate students. My recent focus has been on teaching research methods courses that introduce programming and data analytics to students, particularly using Python and R. I also have extensive experience teaching applied machine learning to students in public policy and social science.
