# Currently Teaching

## University of Chicago, Harris School of Public Policy
### PPHA 30546: Machine Learning 
The objective of this course is to train students to be insightful users of modern machine learning methods. The class covers resampling and regularization methods for regression and classification, as well as common models including decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks. The class uses Python, and is designed for students who have completed the stats core requirements and the first data and programming class, but do not have previous experience with machine learning.

_Taught winter 2025 and autumn 2025._

### PPHA 30537: Data and Programming for Public Policy I (Python)
The first course in the Harris School Certificate in Data Analytics sequence, PPHA 30537 is intended for students with experience using "legacy" research platforms (e.g. Stata) but no background in rigorous coding.  The student taking this course will develop in three technical and three non-technical areas:

  - Learn to write basic Python and apply the PEP8 style guide
  - Gain a deeper understanding of how Python works, including functions and classes
  - Learn the tools of data analysis in Python, including GitHub, Pandas, MatPlotLib, and BeautifulSoup
    
  - Practice good programming and data principles that will benefit the student when working in any platform, including R, Stata, and SAS
  - Understand how good programming relates to reproducible research
  - Develop skills that apply directly to summer internships or entry-level research assistaint positions
    
This course is required in order to take PPHA 30538 and PPHA 30546.

_Taught spring 2019-2025, and summer 2020_

### Math and Coding Camp
I teach the accelerated coding sections of the 3-week long introductory program for incoming MPP and MSCAPP students. The course introduces basic R programming, including tidyverse, plotting, functions, and logic and flow control.

_Taught September 2024 and 2025_

# Previous Courses
## University of Chicago, Harris School of Public Policy
### PPHA 30538/30536: Data and Programming for Public Policy II (Python/R)
This course will build directly on the material covered in PPHA 30537 (or 30535 in R).  We will assume a grasp of the Python (R) skills from the previous class at the start, so that we can focus on practical applications to research.  Whereas the goal of the first class was to introduce Python (R) as a tool for data analysis, and to prepare students for internship-level policy research positions, the goals of this course will be to:

  - Go from simply applying Python (R) to solve research questions, to applying Python (R) professionally, in a way that supports code maintenance, collaboration, efficiency, and readability
  - Deepen existing skills; for example, we will go from learning to create basic plots to discussing the principles of creating good plots
  - Broaden into new skills that require a higher level of Python (R) proficiency 
  - Prepare for the post-graduation job market
    
Note: This course is currently only available in Python, and requires either having taken the first course, or instructor approval.  In the past the course sequence was also offered in R.  

_Taught autumn 2019-2023 in Python, and autumn 2022 and winter 2021 in R_

### PPHA 52000: Individual Reading and Research
Exceptional students from PPHA 30538 and 30536 who have a well-thought-out research idea that they wish to develop further before graduation may request this independent study course.  The course is tailored to each individual, and will be largely self-driven with regular meetings, similar to the way work on a PhD dissertation would proceed. 

_Taught autumn 2023, spring 2023, spring 2021_

### PPHA 23400: Principles of Microeconomics and Public Policy II
This course is the second of a two-part sequence, preceded by Principles of Microeconomics and Public Policy I (PPHA 32300).  We will build on the content of the first class, which focused on perfect competition, by studying the many ways markets fail to act perfectly competitive.  Each section will combine the underlying theory with discussions of practical applications, culminating in a final project that uses published economic research on the topics studied.  Over the quarter, students will learn:

  - Market structure alternatives to perfect competition, e.g. monopoly, oligopoly
  - Sources of and solutions to market failure, e.g. externalities, information asymmetry
  - The basics of applying game theory to the economy
  - Market simulations and modeling
    
This course is intended for students in the MSCAPP program, and will therefore introduce elements of programming to the curriculum.  As such, a solid understanding of the Python programming language is required.

_Taught spring 2019 and 2020_

## University of Chicago, Harris School of Public Policy, Graduate Development Program
I was part of a Harris School program working with a research center within the government of Saudi Arabia.  The program trains top Saudi graduate students in rigorous policy understanding and analysis in preparation for entering public sector work.  I have spent a total of 7 weeks in Riyadh, teaching research methods in Python and R, and basic usage of Excel, PowerBI, and MATLAB.

_Taught autumn 2024 and 20205_

## University of Chicago, Harris School of Public Policy, Data and Policy Summer Scholar Program
Data is everywhere and analytical skills are in high demand by public and private institutions around the world.  Over seven weeks, students in this non-degree program gain the skills to retrieve, analyze, and present data through a public policy lens.  Learn to use a scientific approach to address today's social issues and create a measurable impact on society. 

_Taught summer 2024_

## American University, Department of Economics
### ECON 200: Principles of Microeconomics
Standard introduction to microeconomics for early undergraduate students.

_Taught autumn 2016_
