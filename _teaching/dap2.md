This course will build directly on the material covered in PPHA 30537 (or 30535 in R).  We will assume a grasp of the Python (R) skills from the previous class at the start, so that we can focus on practical applications to research.  Whereas the goal of the first class was to introduce Python (R) as a tool for data analysis, and to prepare students for internship-level policy research positions, the goals of this course will be to:

  - Go from simply applying Python (R) to solve research questions, to applying Python (R) professionally, in a way that supports code maintenance, collaboration, efficiency, and readability
  - Deepen existing skills; for example, we will go from learning to create basic plots to discussing the principles of creating good plots
  - Broaden into new skills that require a higher level of Python (R) proficiency 
  - Prepare for the post-graduation job market
    
Note that this course is currently only available in Python, and requires either having taken the first course, or instructor approval.  I taught this course in Python in Autumn 2019-2023, and in R for Autumn 2022 and Winter 2021.
