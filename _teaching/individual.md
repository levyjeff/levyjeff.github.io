Exceptional students from DAP1 and DAP2 who have a well-thought-out research idea that they wish to develop further before graduation may request this independent study course.  The course is tailored to each individual, and will be largely self-driven with regular meetings, similar to the way work on a PhD dissertation would proceed.
