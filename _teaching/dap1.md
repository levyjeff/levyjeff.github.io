The student taking this course will develop in three technical and three non-technical areas:

    * Learn to write basic Python and apply the PEP8 style guide
    * Gain a deeper understanding of how Python works, including functions and classes
    * Learn the tools of data analysis in Python, including GitHub, Pandas, MatPlotLib, and BeautifulSoup
      
    * Practice good programming and data principles that will benefit the student when working in any platform, including R, Stata, and SAS
    * Understand how good programming relates to reproducible research
    * Develop skills that apply directly to summer internships or entry-level research assistaint positions
      
  This course is required in order to take PPHA 30538 and PPHA 30546.
