The first course in the Harris School Certificate in Data Analytics sequence, PPHA 30537 is intended for students with experience using "legacy" research platforms (e.g. Stata) but no background in rigorous coding.  The student taking this course will develop in three technical and three non-technical areas:

  - Learn to write basic Python and apply the PEP8 style guide
  - Gain a deeper understanding of how Python works, including functions and classes
  - Learn the tools of data analysis in Python, including GitHub, Pandas, MatPlotLib, and BeautifulSoup
    
  - Practice good programming and data principles that will benefit the student when working in any platform, including R, Stata, and SAS
  - Understand how good programming relates to reproducible research
  - Develop skills that apply directly to summer internships or entry-level research assistaint positions
    
This course is required in order to take PPHA 30538 and PPHA 30546.
